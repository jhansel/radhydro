## @package src.newtonStateHandler
#  This file contains a class to handle computing linearized source
#  terms and handles temperature updates during a non-linear TRT solve.
#  Also contains auxilary functions for evaluating TRT functions of interest
#
#  This class is eventually passed to the source builder as source. Although it is
#  has additional features, it is easier to have this class directly implement the
#  evalImplicit etc. functions than using forwarding functions and potentially having
#  the wrong states.
#
#  The documentation for the linearization and solution of non-linear system 
#  derives in detail the equations being generated here.
